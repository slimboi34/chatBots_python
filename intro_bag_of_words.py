Have you ever wondered how an email ends up in the spam folder? Or how customer service phone systems are able to understand what you're saying? From a cleaner inbox to faster 
customer service and virtual assistants that can tell you the weather,
the number of applications using natural language processing (NLP) is rapidly growing. 
NLP is all about how computers work with human language.

Happy coding,
